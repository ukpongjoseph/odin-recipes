        <li>1 lime, cut into wedges (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut a 13x18-inch piece of parchment paper; place on a work surface. Unroll crescent roll dough and place on the parchment paper, slightly overlapping the long sides of the two pieces of dough..</li>
        <li>Lightly flour a rolling pin; roll over the overlapping dough edges and over the perforations to create one 12x17-inch seamless piece of dough. Carefully lift the parchment paper with dough and fit into a 13x18-inch metal sheet pan.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle 1 cup shredded Cheddar evenly over the dough; follow with pulled pork. Scatter drained beans and drained RO-TEL® over pulled pork; sprinkle on green onions, taco seasoning, and remaining 1 cup Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and the visible edges of the crescent dough are browned, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove to a wire rack. Sprinkle crumbled cotija cheese over all.</li>
        <li>Scatter jalapeño slices, avocado slices, and chopped cilantro over if using.</li>
        <li>Cut into 32 squares with a sharp knife or a pizza cutter; place on a warmed serving platter with lime wedges, if using.</li>
    </ol>
